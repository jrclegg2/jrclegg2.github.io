            <br><h1>Welcome!</h1>
            <br><p>I am a current University of Michigan Junior studying in the School of Information with an emphasis in Information Analysis and a minor in Computer Science. I have worked numerous roles across different industries, giving me vast experience. Most recently, I have worked as an Analytics & Reporting Intern at J.Crew Group in New York City. Here, I worked on consolidating excel distributed reports into the BI platform Qlikview. Through this project, I gained valuable insights into working with cross-functional business partners to assess project requirements, as well as seeing a project through from development to UI testing to deployment. While working at J.Crew, I was able to see the ins and outs of how a large company and their many teams operate in a corporate setting. In my last two years I have also held various other roles that have added to my professional development. After my freshmen year, I moved to Branson, Missouri where I was a Communications & Marketing Intern at Ballparks of America, where I managed their social media accounts, official website, and led an effort to craft their first social media reporting processes. I have been a Teacher’s Assistant in the School of Information’s introductory coding course for the last 2 semesters. In this role, I am tasked with mentoring the 250 students and spreading my knowledge and passion for Python and the School of Information’s programs.</p>
            <br><p>Outside of my education, my main hobby is working on TV and film production. Currently, I am a part of WOLV-TV, which is University of Michigan's student-run TV organization, onoe of the only student run TV organizations in the country. At WOLV-TV, I am the Sports Department Director, where I am tasked with leading 4 sports-related shows, 12 producers, and 50+ crew members. In this role, I assist the shows in their organization, membership, viewership, and networking with the University’s SIDs to acquire credentials and exclusive player access. This program has given me extensive experience in solving challenging problems in a fast-paced environment, like live TV production.</p>
